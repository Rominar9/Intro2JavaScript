  <h2 id="paragraph">In todays lesson we learn how to use getElementById method to be able to use elements by thier ids. We also learn how to create a click here button to be able to change the color of the element. we created javascript into html to atomatically change elements on the page based on the element action. we also learn that we can use script.sj to be able to tranfer any information that is on the html into that so it is easeir to function. we learn how to change the color of the background by just clicking a button. there was many mistakes when creating this project but by having other people helping me and trying to figure the bugs out I figure out how to fix my project. </h2>
